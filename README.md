# What is Food Showdown about?

Everyone has had those moments where they think to themselves â€“ "Hmm, what should I eat today?"

Then they go on Yelp and search for food within their area. Everything looks good... But at the same time *nothing* looks good. Food Showdown was created to help those who are indecisive take control of their lives and pick what they're really feeling like eating.

**May the best food win.**

# Tell Me More

Food Showdown utilizes the Yelp Fusion API to randomly select 16 businesses located near the zip code provided. From there, two businesses will be pit against each other until only one more business remains.

Site is still a work in progress and thus some bugs do exist:

- After submitting zip code, please wait a few seconds for businesses to load. A spinning loader is in the works.
- If you would like to do another search, please refresh the page or click on the top left to reset the page.
- Works in mobile, but design is not fully responsive
